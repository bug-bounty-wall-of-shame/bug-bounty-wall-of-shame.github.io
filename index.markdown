In both the marketing and terms for Bizthon, it includes claims that hackathon winners would be paid bounties (non-dilutive capital) from a prize pot of $1M USD. Winners/finalists did not recieve bounties after completing the hackathon but were instead propositioned to trade business equity for $0. Furthermore, there were no reimbursements for travel and lodging to pitch on the TDeFi stage at GITEX in Dubai. Tread with caution. |

Yet it was found to be vulnerable to iframe phishing. Magic Link ignored the vulnerability after eight reminders over a month-long period until it began receiving public scrutiny about the presence of a potential unknown vulnerability. The whitehat suggested a payment of more than $3000 and Magic Link ignored the hacker, paid nothing, and publicly announced its patch as a "new security feature" and their "investment in security" rather than an unpaid whitehat's finding.                                                                                                                                              |

Magic Link's max bounty is $3000. Magic Link paid $1000, falsely claiming it is not critical because it needs a dashboard misconfiguration or XSS to be exploited. Magic Link refused to coordinate a timeline to fix it for months until this issue received more public scrutiny; at that point, they fixed it in days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

During the period from 2022-10-21 to 2022-11-15, the whitehat attempted to offer help and asked for status updates. When the whitehat stated that they would disclose the report according to the policy of report responsibility disclosure (90 days window), they instantly replied that the findings were well-known facts and should be explicitly mentioned in their documentation. Furthermore, they did not allow disclosing the findings due to their self-written security policies. The whitehat then explained the process of public vulnerability submission (for example https://about.google/appsecurity/) and set a deadline of 2023-01-21, but was ignored. |
